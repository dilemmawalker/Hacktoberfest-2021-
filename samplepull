What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:
Prepare and share your project for collaboration
Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
Organize an event
Mentor others
Donate directly to open source projects
